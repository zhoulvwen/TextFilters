Abstract: Regenerative medicine consisting of cells and materials provides a new way for the repair and regeneration of tissues and organs. Nano-biomaterials are highlighted due to their advantageous features compared with conventional micro-materials. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of micro-/nano- sized hydroxyapatite (mu/n-HA) on the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). mu/n-HA were prepared by a microwave synthesizer and precipitation method, respectively. Different sizes of mu/n-HA were characterized by IR, XRD, SEM, TEM and co-cultured with rBMSCs. It was shown that rBMSCs expressed higher levels of osteoblast-related markers by n-HA than mu-HA stimulation. The size of HA is an important factor for affecting the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. This provides a new avenue for mechanistic studies of stem cell differentiation and a new approach to obtain more committed differentiated cells.

Abstract: Nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) can improve axonal connecting in a target direction during regeneration, however, it is limited by the neurotoxicity of CNT. Here we investigate the possible protective effect of nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) against nerve injury, as well as CNT in cultured rat cortical neurons. In this study the nanomaterials were characterized by X-Ray diffractometry (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. Our results showed that axonal migration and extension were increased significantly after n-HA treatment by immunocytochemistry assay. The patch clamp assay results showed that n-HA acts protectively after nerve injury, which inhibited the average amplitude and frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). n-HA is not neurotoxic for the electrophysiology activity of cells. To find the effect of n-HA on axonal guidance growth in the cultured cortical neurons, Netrin 1, one of the axonal guidance cues, was determined by RT-PCR and western blot assay. Compared to the control group, n-HA down-regulated the mRNA level of netrin 1, and moreover, the expression of netrin 1 decreased significantly in the cells. n-HA caused the axonal guidance growth to be mediated by netrin 1 during nerve regeneration. Therefore, the data from the present study provided a new approach for the therapy or prevention of nerve injury.

Abstract: While the advantages of nanomaterials are being increasingly recognized, their potential toxicity is drawing more and more attention and concern. In this study, we explore the toxicity mechanism of 20-30 nm rod-shaped hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. The nanoparticles were prepared by precipitation and characterized by IR, XRD and TEM. Concentrations of 0 mug mL(-1), 10 mug mL(-1), 100 mug mL(-1), 1 mg mL(-1), and 10 mg mL(-1) were applied to the MC3T3-E1 cells for viability (MTT-test). Based on the characteristic differences of the two methods of cell death, the morphological features of the MC3T3-E1 cell line co-cultured with nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) (10 mg mL(-1)) for 24 h were also observed by TEM. Furthermore, important serum biochemical markers and histopathological examinations were used to evaluate the potential toxicological effect of n-HA on the major organs of SD rats injected intraperitoneally with n-HA (33.3 mg kg(-1) body weight). In the results, we found cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells co-cultured with n-HA. Moreover, apoptosis but not necrosis was illustrated in liver and renal tissue by using histopathology slices and serum biochemical markers. It suggests that apoptosis may be the possible mechanism of n-HA toxicity and provides a better understanding of the biocompatibility of nanomaterials applied in human bone repair.

Abstract: The synthesis, characterization and catalytic capability of the NiW-nano-hydroxyapatite (NiW-nHA) composite were investigated in this paper. The NiW-nHA catalyst was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Then Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) were used to analyze this material. In addition, the catalytic capacity of the NiW-nHA composite was also examined by FT-IR and gas chromatography (GC). The results of FT-IR analysis indicated that Ni, W and nHA combined closely. TEM observation revealed that this catalyst was needle shaped and the crystal retained a nanometer size. XRD data also suggested that a new phase of CaWO(4) appeared and the lattice parameters of nHA changed in this system. nHA was the carrier of metals. The rates of Ni/W-loading were 73.24% and 65.99% according to the EDX data, respectively. Furthermore, the conversion of 91.88% Jatropha oil was achieved at 360 degrees C and 3 MPa h(-1) over NiW-nHA catalyst. The straight chain alkanes ranging from C(15) to C(18) were the main components in the production. The yield of C(15)-C(18) alkanes was up to 83.56 wt%. The reaction pathway involved hydrocracking of the C horizontal lineC bonds of these triglycerides from Jatropha oil. This paper developed a novel non-sulfided catalyst to obtain a "green biofuel" from vegetable oil.

Abstract: Employment of nanovehicular system for delivering apoptogenic agent to cancer cells for inducing apoptosis has widely been investigated. Loading efficacy and controlled release of the agents are of the inseparable obstacles that hamper the efforts in reaching an efficacious targeted cancer therapy method. When the carrier itself is apoptogenic, then there is no need to load the carrier with apoptogenic agent and just delivering of the particle to the specific location matters. Hence, we hypothesize that amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticle (ACPN) is a potent candidate for apoptosis induction, although encapsulation in liposome shell, and surface decoration with targeting ligand (TL), and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) plays a pivotal role in the employment of this agent. It is well understood that elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) would result in the induction of apoptosis. ACPN has the potential to cause imbalance in this medium by elevating [Ca2+]c. Owning to the fact that the nanoparticles should be delivered into cytosol, it is necessary to trap them in a liposomal shell for evading endocytosis. It was demonstrated that employment of the trans-activator of transcription (TAT) as CPP eminently enhances the efficacy of endosomal escape; therefore, the platform is designed in a way that TAT is positioned on the surface of the liposome. Due to the fact that the apoptosis should be induced in sole cancer cells, Folate as TL is also attached on the surface of the liposome. This hypothesis heralds the new generation of chemotherapeutic agents and platforms which could have less side effect than the most common ones, in addition to other advantages they have.

Abstract: A new approach for fabrication of a long-term and recoverable antimicrobial nanostructure/textile hybrid without increasing the antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated. Using in situ synthesized Ag nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on ZnO nanowires (NWs) grown on textiles by a 'dip-in and light-irradiation' green chemical method, we obtained ZnONW@AgNP nanocomposites with small-size and uniform Ag NPs, which have shown superior performance for antibacterial applications. These new Ag/ZnO/textile antimicrobial composites can be used for wound dressings and medical textiles for topical and prophylactic antibacterial treatments, point-of-use water treatment to improve the cleanliness of water and antimicrobial air filters to prevent bioaerosols accumulating in ventilation, heating, and air-conditioning systems.

Abstract: The cell's cytoskeleton, providing the cell with structure and shape, consists of a complex array of structural proteins, including microtubules, microfilaments and intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments play a crucial role in mechanotransduction and in providing mechanical stability to cells, in particular under large deformation. By utilizing molecular simulation, here we report a nanomechanical analysis of vimentin intermediate filament dimers, the basic building blocks of intermediate filaments. We describe a detailed analysis of the mechanical properties and associated deformation mechanisms, and find that mechanical stretch induces a transition from alpha-helices to beta-sheets, a phenomenon known as alpha-beta transition. A comparison of the Young's modulus predicted from simulation with experimental measurements is provided, and good agreement is found. We present an analysis of structural changes during deformation, domain unfolding patterns, rate dependence of the rupture force and associated changes in the energy landscape, and conclude with a discussion of potential implications for mechanobiology and the development of de novo protein materials.

Abstract: Mechanical stress is increasingly being shown to be a potent modulator of cell-cell junctional morphologies in developmental and homeostatic processes. Intercellular force sensing is thus expected to be an important regulator of cell signalling and tissue integrity. In particular, the interplay between myosin contractility, actin dynamics and E-cadherin recruitment largely remains to be uncovered. We devised a suspended cell doublet assay to quantitatively assess the correlation between myosin II activity and local E-cadherin recruitment. The single junction of the doublet exhibited a stereotypical morphology, with E-cadherin accumulating into clusters of varied concentrations at the rim of the circular contact. This local recruitment into clusters derived from the sequestration of E-cadherin through a myosin-II-driven modulation of actin turnover. We exemplify how the regulation of actin dynamics provides a mechanism for the mechanosensitive response of cell contacts.

Abstract: American Heart Association type IV plaques consist of a lipid core covered by a fibrous cap, and develop at locations of eccentric low shear stress. Vascular remodeling initially preserves the lumen diameter while maintaining the low shear stress conditions that encourage plaque growth. When these plaques eventually start to intrude into the lumen, the shear stress in the area surrounding the plaque changes substantially, increasing tensile stress at the plaque shoulders and exacerbating fissuring and thrombosis. Local biologic effects induced by high shear stress can destabilize the cap, particularly on its upstream side, and turn it into a rupture-prone, vulnerable plaque. Tensile stress is the ultimate mechanical factor that precipitates rupture and atherothrombotic complications. The shear-stress-oriented view of plaque rupture has important therapeutic implications. In this review, we discuss the varying mechanobiologic mechanisms in the areas surrounding the plaque that might explain the otherwise paradoxical observations and unexpected outcomes of experimental therapies.

Abstract: Although soluble inhibitors are frequently used to block cell binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mechanical stretching of a protein fibre alone can physically destroy a cell-binding site. Here, we show using binding assays and steered molecular dynamics that mechanical tension along fibronectin (Fn) fibres causes a structural mismatch between Fn-binding proteins from Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Both adhesins target a multimodular site on Fn that is switched to low affinity by stretching the intermodular distances on Fn. Heparin reduces binding but does not eliminate mechanosensitivity. These adhesins might thus preferentially bind to sites at which ECM fibres are cleaved, such as wounds or inflamed tissues. The mechanical switch described here operates differently from the catch bond mechanism that Escherichia coli uses to adhere to surfaces under fluid flow. Demonstrating the existence of a mechanosensitive cell-binding site provides a new perspective on how the mechanobiology of ECM might regulate bacterial and cell-binding events, virulence and the course of infection.

Abstract: In the body, soft tissues often undergo cycles of stretching and relaxation that may affect cell behaviour without changing matrix rigidity. To determine whether transient forces can substitute for a rigid matrix, we stretched soft pillar arrays. Surprisingly, 1-5% cyclic stretching over a frequency range of 0.01-10 Hz caused spreading and stress fibre formation (optimum 0.1 Hz) that persisted after 4 h of stretching. Similarly, stretching increased cell growth rates on soft pillars comparative to rigid substrates. Of possible factors linked to fibroblast growth, MRTF-A (myocardin-related transcription factor-A) moved to the nucleus in 2 h of cyclic stretching and reversed on cessation; but YAP (Yes-associated protein) moved much later. Knockdown of either MRTF-A or YAP blocked stretch-dependent growth. Thus, we suggest that the repeated pulling from a soft matrix can substitute for a stiff matrix in stimulating spreading, stress fibre formation and growth.

Abstract: The closure of gaps within epithelia is crucial to maintain its integrity during biological processes such as wound healing and gastrulation. Depending on the distribution of extracellular matrix, gap closure occurs through assembly of multicellular actin-based contractile cables or protrusive activity of border cells into the gap. Here we show that the supracellular actomyosin contractility of cells near the gap edge exerts sufficient tension on the surrounding tissue to promote closure of non-adherent gaps. Using traction force microscopy, we observe that cell-generated forces on the substrate at the gap edge first point away from the centre of the gap and then increase in the radial direction pointing into the gap as closure proceeds. Combining with numerical simulations, we show that the increase in force relies less on localized purse-string contractility and more on large-scale remodelling of the suspended tissue around the gap. Our results provide a framework for understanding the assembly and the mechanics of cellular contractility at the tissue level.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that cytoplasmic actin filaments are essential factors in the modulation of nuclear shape and function. However, the mechanistic understanding of the internal orchestration between cell and nuclear shape is still lacking. Here we show that orientation and deformation of the nucleus are regulated by lateral compressive forces driven by tension in central actomyosin fibres. By using a combination of micro-manipulation tools, our study reveals that tension in central stress fibres is gradually generated by anisotropic force contraction dipoles, which expand as the cell elongates and spreads. Our findings indicate that large-scale cell shape changes induce a drastic condensation of chromatin and dramatically affect cell proliferation. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple mechanical model that quantitatively accounts for our experimental data and provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic coordination between cell and nuclear shape.

Abstract: Force sensing at cadherin-mediated adhesions is critical for their proper function. alpha-Catenin, which links cadherins to actomyosin, has a crucial role in this mechanosensing process. It has been hypothesized that force promotes vinculin binding, although this has never been demonstrated. X-ray structure further suggests that alpha-catenin adopts a stable auto-inhibitory conformation that makes the vinculin-binding site inaccessible. Here, by stretching single alpha-catenin molecules using magnetic tweezers, we show that the subdomains MI vinculin-binding domain (VBD) to MIII unfold in three characteristic steps: a reversible step at ~5 pN and two non-equilibrium steps at 10-15 pN. 5 pN unfolding forces trigger vinculin binding to the MI domain in a 1:1 ratio with nanomolar affinity, preventing MI domain refolding after force is released. Our findings demonstrate that physiologically relevant forces reversibly unfurl alpha-catenin, activating vinculin binding, which then stabilizes alpha-catenin in its open conformation, transforming force into a sustainable biochemical signal.

Abstract: The ability of skin to act as a barrier is primarily determined by the efficiency of skin cells to maintain and restore its continuity and integrity. In fact, during wound healing keratinocytes migrate collectively to maintain their cohesion despite heterogeneities in the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that monolayers of human keratinocytes migrating along functionalized micropatterned surfaces comprising alternating strips of extracellular matrix (fibronectin) and non-adherent polymer form suspended multicellular bridges over the non-adherent areas. The bridges are held together by intercellular adhesion and are subjected to considerable tension, as indicated by the presence of prominent actin bundles. We also show that a model based on force propagation through an elastic material reproduces the main features of bridge maintenance and tension distribution. Our findings suggest that multicellular bridges maintain tissue integrity during wound healing when cell-substrate interactions are weak and may prove helpful in the design of artificial scaffolds for skin regeneration.
