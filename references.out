Abstract: Mechanical stress is increasingly being shown to be a potent modulator of cell-cell junctional morphologies in developmental and homeostatic processes. Intercellular force sensing is thus expected to be an important regulator of cell signalling and tissue integrity. In particular, the interplay between myosin contractility, actin dynamics and E-cadherin recruitment largely remains to be uncovered. We devised a suspended cell doublet assay to quantitatively assess the correlation between myosin II activity and local E-cadherin recruitment. The single junction of the doublet exhibited a stereotypical morphology, with E-cadherin accumulating into clusters of varied concentrations at the rim of the circular contact. This local recruitment into clusters derived from the sequestration of E-cadherin through a myosin-II-driven modulation of actin turnover. We exemplify how the regulation of actin dynamics provides a mechanism for the mechanosensitive response of cell contacts.

Abstract: Although soluble inhibitors are frequently used to block cell binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mechanical stretching of a protein fibre alone can physically destroy a cell-binding site. Here, we show using binding assays and steered molecular dynamics that mechanical tension along fibronectin (Fn) fibres causes a structural mismatch between Fn-binding proteins from Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Both adhesins target a multimodular site on Fn that is switched to low affinity by stretching the intermodular distances on Fn. Heparin reduces binding but does not eliminate mechanosensitivity. These adhesins might thus preferentially bind to sites at which ECM fibres are cleaved, such as wounds or inflamed tissues. The mechanical switch described here operates differently from the catch bond mechanism that Escherichia coli uses to adhere to surfaces under fluid flow. Demonstrating the existence of a mechanosensitive cell-binding site provides a new perspective on how the mechanobiology of ECM might regulate bacterial and cell-binding events, virulence and the course of infection.

Abstract: In the body, soft tissues often undergo cycles of stretching and relaxation that may affect cell behaviour without changing matrix rigidity. To determine whether transient forces can substitute for a rigid matrix, we stretched soft pillar arrays. Surprisingly, 1-5% cyclic stretching over a frequency range of 0.01-10 Hz caused spreading and stress fibre formation (optimum 0.1 Hz) that persisted after 4 h of stretching. Similarly, stretching increased cell growth rates on soft pillars comparative to rigid substrates. Of possible factors linked to fibroblast growth, MRTF-A (myocardin-related transcription factor-A) moved to the nucleus in 2 h of cyclic stretching and reversed on cessation; but YAP (Yes-associated protein) moved much later. Knockdown of either MRTF-A or YAP blocked stretch-dependent growth. Thus, we suggest that the repeated pulling from a soft matrix can substitute for a stiff matrix in stimulating spreading, stress fibre formation and growth.

Abstract: The closure of gaps within epithelia is crucial to maintain its integrity during biological processes such as wound healing and gastrulation. Depending on the distribution of extracellular matrix, gap closure occurs through assembly of multicellular actin-based contractile cables or protrusive activity of border cells into the gap. Here we show that the supracellular actomyosin contractility of cells near the gap edge exerts sufficient tension on the surrounding tissue to promote closure of non-adherent gaps. Using traction force microscopy, we observe that cell-generated forces on the substrate at the gap edge first point away from the centre of the gap and then increase in the radial direction pointing into the gap as closure proceeds. Combining with numerical simulations, we show that the increase in force relies less on localized purse-string contractility and more on large-scale remodelling of the suspended tissue around the gap. Our results provide a framework for understanding the assembly and the mechanics of cellular contractility at the tissue level.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that cytoplasmic actin filaments are essential factors in the modulation of nuclear shape and function. However, the mechanistic understanding of the internal orchestration between cell and nuclear shape is still lacking. Here we show that orientation and deformation of the nucleus are regulated by lateral compressive forces driven by tension in central actomyosin fibres. By using a combination of micro-manipulation tools, our study reveals that tension in central stress fibres is gradually generated by anisotropic force contraction dipoles, which expand as the cell elongates and spreads. Our findings indicate that large-scale cell shape changes induce a drastic condensation of chromatin and dramatically affect cell proliferation. On the basis of these findings, we propose a simple mechanical model that quantitatively accounts for our experimental data and provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic coordination between cell and nuclear shape.

Abstract: Force sensing at cadherin-mediated adhesions is critical for their proper function. alpha-Catenin, which links cadherins to actomyosin, has a crucial role in this mechanosensing process. It has been hypothesized that force promotes vinculin binding, although this has never been demonstrated. X-ray structure further suggests that alpha-catenin adopts a stable auto-inhibitory conformation that makes the vinculin-binding site inaccessible. Here, by stretching single alpha-catenin molecules using magnetic tweezers, we show that the subdomains MI vinculin-binding domain (VBD) to MIII unfold in three characteristic steps: a reversible step at ~5 pN and two non-equilibrium steps at 10-15 pN. 5 pN unfolding forces trigger vinculin binding to the MI domain in a 1:1 ratio with nanomolar affinity, preventing MI domain refolding after force is released. Our findings demonstrate that physiologically relevant forces reversibly unfurl alpha-catenin, activating vinculin binding, which then stabilizes alpha-catenin in its open conformation, transforming force into a sustainable biochemical signal.

Abstract: The ability of skin to act as a barrier is primarily determined by the efficiency of skin cells to maintain and restore its continuity and integrity. In fact, during wound healing keratinocytes migrate collectively to maintain their cohesion despite heterogeneities in the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that monolayers of human keratinocytes migrating along functionalized micropatterned surfaces comprising alternating strips of extracellular matrix (fibronectin) and non-adherent polymer form suspended multicellular bridges over the non-adherent areas. The bridges are held together by intercellular adhesion and are subjected to considerable tension, as indicated by the presence of prominent actin bundles. We also show that a model based on force propagation through an elastic material reproduces the main features of bridge maintenance and tension distribution. Our findings suggest that multicellular bridges maintain tissue integrity during wound healing when cell-substrate interactions are weak and may prove helpful in the design of artificial scaffolds for skin regeneration.
